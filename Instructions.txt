1) Push Run

2) Where you see debug, this is my way of saying, this code is just here to show what is happening. It can be removed later.



3) Generate bigger random numbers

randomNum = random.randint(1,2)


4) Change the color of the info bars

print (myList, "%s%s The list of random numbers %s" % (fg('green'), bg('purple_3'), attr('reset')))

find the color info in links.txt

5) Do something with the list. Change the text to make it more interesting. 

print(f'There are {lengthIs} hats in the shop.')

6) add descriptions where you see #comment

7) Remove debug

8) submit your work for review.
